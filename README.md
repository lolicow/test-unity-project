# test-unity-project
my first unity project

This is a task given by the lead unity engineer in the studio I'm currently working when I said I want to switch my job from a designer to a programmer.

So he said, make something so I know you can at least finish the simple tasks I might give you in the future.

I then learnt unity for one week and finish this in 3 days. I consider this as my first successful  unity project.

However it is made in such a short period that the comment for it is quite poor.

This project was finally reviewed in unity 5.0 , so you might need that to open it.
